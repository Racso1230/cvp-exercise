# cvp-excersise

A catalogue displaying products that CVP sell.

Have used a variety of methods to display data and have tried to follow OOP principles and have used GIT frequently to document how I have completed this task. This task has allowed me to utilise some different functions that I was somewhat unfamiliar with and has also allowed me to improve my php skills using PDO as the main connection method.
